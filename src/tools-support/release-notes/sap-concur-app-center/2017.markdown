If you have experienced issues, please use the History function in your Starbucks mobile app or Starbucks account online to manually create a transaction if it hasn't been posted.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We will continue provide fully supported third-party apps via the Concur App Center that make it easier to plan the perfect trip, manage company spend, and make expensing effortless.
